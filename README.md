## Projects
### AI-Powered Email Automation for Sponsorship Inquiries
[Project Link](https://github.com/darshika1994/action-enabled-ai)

Developed an automated email management system using **n8n**, Gmail API, OpenAI API, and Google Sheets API. The system automatically identifies sponsorship-related emails, sends personalized replies, and logs key details in Google Sheets for tracking. Non-relevant emails are ignored to reduce inbox clutter. This system **saves time** and **boosts efficiency by automating** quick, consistent sponsorship replies while keeping leads organized.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
